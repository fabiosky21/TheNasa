  `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nasa-explorer.git`  
  `cd nasa-explorer`  
  `cd backend && npm install`  
  `cd ../frontend && npm install`

- **Create `.env` files in both `/backend` and `/frontend`:**
  - **Backend (`backend/.env`):**
    - `NASA_API_KEY=your_nasa_key`
    - `CO_API_KEY=your_cohere_key`
    - `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url`
    - `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key`
  - **Frontend (`frontend/.env`):**
    - `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url`
    - `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key`
    - `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=your_deployed_backend_url`  <!-- üö® IMPORTANT -->

> **Note:**  
> After you have finished setting up and deploying your backend, replace `your_deployed_backend_url` with the actual URL where your backend API is live (e.g., `https://your-backend.onrender.com`).  
> This ensures your frontend communicates with the correct backend in production.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running Locally

- **Start backend:**  
  `cd backend && node server.js`
- **Start frontend:**  
  `cd frontend && npm start`
- **Frontend connects to backend and Supabase using your `.env` settings**

---

## üß™ Testing using Jest

- **Frontend tests:**  
  `npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event jest`  
  `npm install --save-dev @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react babel-jest @babel/core`  
  `npm test`
- **Backend tests:**  
  `npm install --save-dev supertest`  
  _If test script fails, remove `"type": "module"` from package.json and add `test: jest` to scripts_  
  `npm test`
- **Note:**  
  If testing fails with `react-router-dom` v7+, downgrade to v6:  
  `npm install react-router-dom@6`

## üöÄ Deployment

Deploy both backend and frontend as separate services using your chosen deployment platform (for this I use Render).  
Below is a general guide using GitHub integration:

### 1. **Create an Account and Connect Your GitHub**
- Sign up using GitHub, or connect your GitHub account.
- Import your project repository.

### 2. **Deploy the Backend (Node/Express API)**
- Navigate to your imported project in the dashboard (e.g., ‚Äúthenasa‚Äù).
- **Create a new Web Service** for your backend:
    - **Region:** Choose your preferred region (e.g., `Frankfurt`)
    - **Branch:** `main` (or your default branch)
    - **Root directory:** `backend`
    - **Build command:** `npm install`
    - **Start command:** `node server.js`
- Scroll down and click **Deploy**.
- Wait for the deployment to finish (you‚Äôll see a green ‚ÄúDeployed‚Äù status).
- **Copy the generated backend link** (e.g., `https://thenasa-backend.onrender.com`).

### 3. **Update Frontend Environment Variable**
- In `/frontend/.env`, set:
    ```
    REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=your-backend-link-here
    ```
- This ensures the frontend communicates with the deployed backend.

### 4. **Deploy the Frontend (React App)**
- In your dashboard, create a **Static Site** for the frontend:
    - **Root directory:** `frontend`
    - **Build command:** `npm install && npm run build`
    - **Publish directory:** `build`
- Click **Deploy**.
- Wait until the deployment is complete (look for a green ‚ÄúDeployed‚Äù badge).
- **Copy the frontend URL** (e.g., `https://thenasa-frontend.onrender.com`).

### **IMPORTANT:**
> The `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` variable in your frontend `.env` file **must be set to your deployed backend link**.  
> This is essential for your frontend and backend to communicate.

---

**After deployment, you will have:**
- **Frontend:** `https://your-frontend-url`
- **Backend:** `https://your-backend-url`
- The frontend will use the backend URL for all API requests.

## üõü Troubleshooting & Tips

- **Check your `.env` files and Supabase settings if you see errors**
- **Enable anonymous insert policies on Supabase for public submissions**
- **AI features require valid NASA and Cohere API keys**

## üêû Known Issues

- **Google Chrome API Inconsistency:**  
  Occasionally, API requests to NASA Tech Transfer may fail or behave unexpectedly in Google Chrome. Clearing the cache can sometimes help, but it is not guaranteed to resolve the issue. This problem occurs on the home page, specifically in the second section labeled "NASA Tech Transfer". The rest pages and API's works fine.  
  In contrast, the same feature and rest of the project works perfectly and smoothly in Firefox and Microsoft Edge.    
  - **Status:** Intermittent; cause is under investigation.  
  - **Workaround:** If you experience loading issues in Chrome, it is **recomended** , use Firefox or Edge.

> **Note on API Keys:**  
> This project uses public/free API keys for NASA and Supabase. These keys are intended for use in client-side and open source projects‚Äîno sensitive or paid resources are exposed.  
> **Important:** Public API keys may reach a request limit or quota, especially if multiple users are testing the project at the same time.  
> For best results, it is advisable to [create your own API keys](https://api.nasa.gov/) and follow the setup steps provided in this README.
